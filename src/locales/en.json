      "contextFirstParagraph": "flow is not a collection of poems so much as a current you step into. the book bends form, looping through tides, moons, and the quiet machinery of the universe. water rises, falls, returns. language dissolves and reforms. pages echo like waves against the shore—always the same, never the same.",
      "contextSecondParagraph": "it's not meant to be read once. it's meant to be lived through, like a cycle: inhale, exhale. ebb, surge. loss, return."

    "research": {
      "title": "research",
      "contextFirstParagraph": "the research that i'm exploring is how different frequencies — auditory, environmental, and interpersonal — affect nervous system regulation, perception, and embodiment.",
      "contextSecondParagraph": "traditional neuroscience focuses on stimulus-response. i'm focused on an expanded model of awareness, where subtle frequencies (theta, delta, infrasonic) create shifts not just in cognition, but in identity, memory, and connection.",
      "contextThirdParagraph": "through blending biometrics (HRV, EEG) with qualitative somatic feedback, i want to explore how states of deep coherence (induced by sound, stillness, and relational presence) alter what people remember, sense, and even attract.",
      "contextFourthParagraph": "i'm especially interested in how women's nervous systems — attuned to lunar, hormonal, and energetic rhythms — respond differently to deep frequency states. what is perceived as 'sensitivity' may in fact be advanced perception.",
      "contextFifthParagraph": "ultimately, the goal is to bridge scientific and metaphysical perspectives: to prove what mystics have always known — coherence heals. resonance remembers.",
      "goalFirst": "research the physiological effects of low-frequency sound on the nervous system (especially in womb states)",
      "goalSecond": "develop frameworks to study perception as a measurable field influenced by coherence",
      "goalThird": "collect data on emotional, energetic, and intuitive changes during deep frequency exposure",
      "goalFourth": "reclaim sensitivity as intelligence — especially in feminine-bodied beings"

    "sound": {
      "title": "sound",
      "contextFirstParagraph": "i work with sound as a language the body already knows.",
      "contextSecondParagraph": "through piano, guitar, and intuitive composition, i explore how frequency and resonance affect the nervous system, memory, and subtle states of being.",
      "contextThirdParagraph": "my practice is rooted in the belief that sound isn't just heard — it's felt, remembered, and carried through the body like a wave.",
      "contextFourthParagraph": "i'm interested in how music becomes medicine, how vibration reorganizes the field, and how certain tones can open spaces that words can't.",
      "contextFifthParagraph": "each composition becomes a kind of transmission — not to perform, but to attune.",
      "contextSixthParagraph": "the goal isn't performance, it's presence. coherence. remembering.",
      "contextSeventhParagraph": "i'm currently exploring how to create immersive experiences where people can feel the shifts in their own system through sound — where healing isn't an effort, but a frequency.",
      "goalFirst": "redefine sound as a modality of healing rather than entertainment",
      "goalSecond": "compose music that allows people to enter altered states naturally",
      "goalThird": "build a body of work that bridges intuitive musicianship with somatic coherence",
      "goalFourth": "collaborate with artists, healers, and scientists to deepen the impact of resonant sound in integrative spaces"

      "contextFirstParagraph": "threshold is my offering to the world.",
      "contextSecondParagraph": "born from my own search for a place to simply be, threshold is a living emotional habitat.",
      "contextThirdParagraph": "our world rewards overstimulation. i was praised while my nervous system unraveled. there was no space that asked me to breathe, no design that held me in presence.",
      "contextFourthParagraph": "threshold is my answer.",
      "contextFifthParagraph": "not wellness. not productivity. it's presence technology. environments that listen to the body. architecture that regulates instead of fragments. design that restores instead of extracts.",
      "contextSixthParagraph": "threshold is a practice, a process, and a product. it is a way to come home to yourself in a world that never stops pulling you away. a sanctuary built from neuroscience, sensory design, and care.",
      "contextSeventhParagraph": "i'm building threshold in public, as a way to share the journey and invite others to join. if you're curious, come say hi at https://threshold.to"

      "title": "go all in",
      "contextFirstParagraph": "the best decision i've made recently? going all in. no more plan b's, c's, or exit strategies. i asked myself: who are these backup plans actually serving? because it definitely wasn't me. they were just dressed-up doubts, cloaked in logic, disguised as 'being smart.'",
      "contextSecondParagraph": "here's what i learned: when you're half-in, half-out, you create resistance. the universe doesn't move for hesitation. it moves for clarity. wavering keeps you in limbo and you'll never witness what's possible if you're too scared to claim it.",
      "contextThirdParagraph": "let's bring it into reality: you can dream and visualize forever, but the step toward that dream — the actual movement — is the spell. so many of us silence our callings under the weight of 'not realistic' or 'not stable yet.' we wait for the myth of readiness. spoiler: it doesn't come. not all the way.",
      "contextFourthParagraph": "you'll feel fear. doubt. maybe even grief. but that's not a red light — that's proof you're touching something real. when you move toward what's truly yours, your old identities will push back. so will people. especially the ones who abandoned their own dreams. that's the green light, babe.",
      "contextFifthParagraph": "so… if you've been itching to begin, this is your call. if a part of you is whispering 'leave the job, make the art, write the thing, move across the world' — listen. and if your circle doesn't support it? good. now you know whose frequency you're outgrowing. don't let their unlived lives shrink your vision.",
      "contextSixthParagraph": "you are the artist. the canvas. the paint. the whole damn gallery. you really think you came here to play small? 'but what about my ____?' nope. not letting you finish that sentence. every excuse is just fear rehearsing the same song of safety. and safety is not the same as aliveness.",
      "contextSeventhParagraph": "let this be the moment you choose expansion. radical permission. say yes to the thing before you know how. when i gave the creative force full access to my life, it remade me. it taught me new languages — visual, sonic, energetic. i stopped boxing myself into labels. i just… became. and in that formlessness, i could do anything.",
      "contextEighthParagraph": "one day i was writing poems, the next i was building healing technology. one night i wrote a whole book in 6 hours. another day, i started drawing like i'd done it for lifetimes. i stopped waiting to be 'ready' and just said: okay, show me.",
      "contextNinthParagraph": "remember what bruce lee said? be water. fluid. shapeless. water doesn't resist the vessel — it becomes it. that's your task now. dissolve the edges. unform the form. trust the movement inside you more than the logic that cages it.",
      "contextFinalParagraph": "so this is me, telling you as a friend: go all in. be water. and watch what unfolds."
